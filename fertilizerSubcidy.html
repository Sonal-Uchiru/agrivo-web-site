                Paddy cultivation, a fundamental aspect of Sri Lanka's
                agriculture and cultural heritage, has a rich history spanning
                over two millennia. It has played a significant role in shaping
                the nation's socio-economic fabric and is closely tied to the
                lives of its people. Rice, the staple food in Sri Lanka,
                symbolizes self-sufficiency and is deeply ingrained in the
                country's history. Over time, paddy cultivation in Sri Lanka has
                undergone notable transformations, from ancient hydraulic
                systems to modern mechanized farming methods. These changes have
                been influenced by technology, environmental factors, and
                socio-economic shifts, which are critical to understanding the
                present state of rice farming in the country. Today, paddy
                cultivation in Sri Lanka faces several challenges, including
                climate change, land disputes, and changing dietary preferences.
                These issues have direct implications for rice production.
                Additionally, the country's integration into global markets and
                economic development efforts have led to shifts in agricultural
                policies and practices. Nutrient management is crucial for
                successful paddy cultivation, with rice crops requiring various
                nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, sulfur,
                calcium, magnesium, iron, zinc, and manganese. Proper fertilizer
                management is essential to achieve high yields, as overuse can
                lead to environmental issues, while inadequate application can
                result in lower yields and nutrient deficiencies.
              </p>

              <p class="description">
                Sri Lanka has implemented a fertilizer subsidy program, which
                aims to reduce the cost of fertilizers and promote their use to
                enhance agricultural output. The government provides four types
                of fertilizers to farmers, some for free and others at a
                discounted rate. While the program has contributed to the growth
                of the agriculture sector and improved food security, it has
                also faced criticisms related to issues like corruption,
                leakage, and unsustainable fertilizer usage. Efficient
                fertilizer application, following the 4Rs framework (correct
                source, amount, timing, and placement of nutrients), is
                essential to maximize the effectiveness of fertilizers. Proper
                timing of fertilization is crucial to minimize nutrient losses
                and enhance plant uptake. The current distribution of fertilizer
                subsidies in Sri Lanka is a manual process, involving farmer
                registration, field inspections, and token distribution. This
                system operates on a first-come-first-served basis, and there
                have been calls for reforms to address issues in the
                distribution process.

                Examines the Fertilizer Subsidy Program in Sri Lanka, explaining
                its structure and issues. The authors suggest policy options for
                the program while considering economic, environmental, and
                socio-political factors. They mention that fertilizer subsidies
                in developing countries can lead to misuse, corruption, and
                dependency. The government has options to continue the current
                policy, fully remove the subsidy, or reform it by supporting
                target groups at a minimal cost. The government can also combine
                these options into different policy packages, such as targeting
                deserving farmers, using vouchers, or gradually reducing the
                subsidy rate.

              <h3>Research B</h3>

              <p>
                H. K. J. Ekanayake has done an in-depth analysis of the impact
                of the fertilizer subsidy on paddy cultivation in Sri Lanka by
                using separate demand functions along with a simple regression
                model. The research found that fertilizer demand functions could
                vary according to the type of fertilizer, but in general,
                fertilizer demand is not significantly affected by changes in
                its own price, output price, and related policies in the short
                run. Farmers tend to apply fertilizer despite difficulties to
                ensure optimum yield levels. However, an increase in fertilizer
                prices could reduce farmers' profits by increasing the cost of
                production. Increasing paddy prices or decreasing fertilizer
                prices are alternatives available to the government to provide
                incentives to paddy farmers in the short run, but policymakers
                should weigh the pros and cons of each option. A well-targeted
                subsidy scheme, which is gradually phased out, is preferred in
                the short run, and public expenditure should focus on providing
                infrastructure and institutional facilities required to improve
                efficiency in paddy marketing to allow paddy prices to be
                attractive. Once productivity and profitability in paddy
                cultivation are increased to an acceptable level, fertilizer
                subsidy could be withdrawn completely.

              <p>
                The study examines the impact of fertilizer use on paddy
                production in Sri Lanka from 1962 to 2020 using the ARDL-ECM
                approach. Results show that fertilizer use and cultivation
                extent have positive and statistically significant elasticities
                in both the short and long run. Fertilizer contributes 35% to
                output growth and has a positive effect on productivity,
                although its contribution has declined over time. Restricting
                fertilizer supply can negatively affect rice production.
                Therefore, there is a need for more sustainable fertilizer
                policies that take into account market implications domestically
                and internationally. Policies related to land, fertilizer, or
                other fundamental inputs require experimentation for
                understanding and should be accorded time for the effects to be
                realized.

            The three analyzed research articles explore the impact of the
            fertilizer subsidy program on paddy cultivation in Sri Lanka. The
            articles suggest policy changes, like gradually getting rid of the
            subsidies and using fertilizer in a more sustainable way. However,
            they didn't explain how to actually make these changes happen in Sri
            Lanka's current situation. In addition, they didn’t address the
            challenges of applying fertilizer in a timely manner to the paddy
            fields.

            the fertilizer subsidy program which needs immediate attention is
            the absence of a priority-based fertilizer distribution process.
