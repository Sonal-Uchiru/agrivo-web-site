                Since rice has been the main food source in Sri Lanka for
                centuries, paddy cultivation has been a significant agricultural
                activity. Research on paddy cultivation in Sri Lanka has been
                focused on improving the productivity, efficiency, and
                sustainability of rice farming. The utilization of research
                findings has led to significant improvements in the quality and
                quantity of rice production, contributing to the country's food
                security and economic development. The country is privileged to
                have an institutional framework that is well-organized for the
                creation and transfer of knowledge and technologies. Through its
                main division, the Rice Research and Development Institute
                (RRDI) in Bathalagoda, and several other regional centers spread
                out across the nation, the DoA is specifically involved in the
                development of rice technologies. The Rice Research and
                Development Institute (RRDI) in Sri Lanka is a leading research
                institution dedicated to increasing the productivity,
                efficiency, and sustainability of the country's rice farming.
                The institute oversees the creation of high-yielding rice
                varieties, enhancing farming methods, and promoting
                environmentally friendly farming practices. The development of
                rice farming in Sri Lanka as well as the food security and
                economic growth of the nation have all benefited greatly from
                the research findings. The development of high-yielding rice
                varieties is one of the most important paddy cultivation
                research findings in Sri Lanka. The well-known BG 352, BG 357,
                and BG 360 varieties of rice are just a few of the improved rice
                varieties created by researchers at the Rice Research and
                Development Institute (RRDI).
              </p>

              <p class="description">
                Since the introduction of these high-yielding varieties, rice
                production has significantly increased, enhancing farmer income.
                Furthermore, research has resulted in the development of
                improved paddy cultivation practices in Sri Lanka. The use of
                modern irrigation systems, such as drip irrigation and sprinkler
                irrigation, for example, has helped to conserve water while
                increasing rice yields. The use of harmful pesticides has been
                reduced because of the adoption of integrated pest management
                systems, making rice production safer and healthier for farmers
                and consumers. Moreover, the findings of the research have
                resulted in the development of new and improved rice based
                products in Sri Lanka. For example, the RRDI has created new
                markets for rice farmers by developing new rice flour and rice
                bran oil products, thereby increasing their income and economic
                development. The usage of research findings has also resulted in
                the adoption of environmentally friendly farming practices in
                Sri Lanka. For example, the use of organic fertilizers and other
                environmentally friendly farming methods has reduced the
                environmental impact of paddy cultivation in the country. The
                implementation of a rice intensification system (SRI) has also
                assisted in reducing the amount of water and fertilizer used in
                rice farming while increasing yields. Finally, the usage of
                paddy cultivation research findings has significantly aided the
                development of rice farming in Sri Lanka. Rice productivity has
                increased, costs have decreased, and the environmental impact of
                paddy cultivation has been reduced because of the adoption of
                high-yielding rice varieties, improved farming practices, and
                sustainable farming techniques. As a result, continuing to
                invest in research is critical to ensuring that rice farming in
                Sri Lanka remains sustainable, profitable, and capable of
                contributing to the country's economic development and food
                security.

          <p class="describe">
            Rice research in Sri Lanka has been instrumental in transforming
            paddy farming practices, leading to increased productivity and
            improved agricultural sustainability. However, the full potential of
            these research findings has yet to be realized due to several
            critical challenges in disseminating the knowledge generated by
            research institutions to the end users, primarily small-scale
            farmers. This introduction aims to provide an overview of the
            existing dissemination landscape, highlighting the need for further
            research and intervention. Rice is the staple food of Sri Lanka, and
            its cultivation is of paramount importance to the country's food
            security and economy. Over the years, research institutions like the
            Rice Research and Development Institute (RRDI), Hector Kobbekaduwa
            Agrarian Research and Training Institute (HORDI), and the Field
            Crops Research and Development Institute (FCRDI) have made
            significant strides in developing high-yielding rice varieties,
            sustainable farming practices, and pest-resistant crops. These
            advancements have the potential to revolutionize rice farming and
            improve the livelihoods of millions of small-scale farmers. Despite
            the valuable research conducted by these institutions, the
            dissemination of research findings to small-scale farmers in Sri
            Lanka faces numerous obstacles. The data presented in the subsequent
            sections of this document identifies some of the primary barriers to
            effective dissemination, including a lack of extension staff, weak
            research-to-extension linkages, inadequate training, and limited
            extension programs. Recognizing the challenges faced by small-scale
            farmers in accessing and utilizing research findings, this research
            seeks to address a significant gap in the existing literature. While
            previous studies have acknowledged these barriers, there is a need
            for a comprehensive analysis that delves deeper into the root causes
            and explores innovative solutions to bridge the dissemination gap.
            This research aims to provide a nuanced understanding of the
            obstacles faced by small-scale farmers and propose strategies to
            enhance the communication and application of research findings in
            their agricultural practices. Closing the dissemination gap is
            imperative for several reasons. First and foremost, it is vital to
            ensure that the investments made in rice research translate into
            tangible benefits for small-scale farmers, thereby improving their
            income and quality of life. Additionally, effective dissemination
            contributes to food security, as it enables farmers to adopt
            sustainable practices and maximize their yield potential. Moreover,
            it can promote economic growth by increasing the overall
            productivity and competitiveness of the rice sector in Sri Lanka. In
            conclusion, rice research in Sri Lanka has the potential to bring
            about transformative changes in paddy farming, but its impact hinges
            on the successful dissemination of research findings to small-scale
            farmers. Recognizing the importance of this issue, this research
            aims to contribute to the existing body of knowledge by identifying
            effective strategies to overcome the barriers to dissemination and
            ensure that the benefits of rice research reach those who need it
            the most.

              <p>
                Small-scale farmers in Sri Lanka face barriers to accessing the
                latest research findings. This is primarily due to a lack of
                effective communication between farmers and research institutes.
                In Sri Lanka, new findings spreading from research centers to
                the local level via agricultural extensions are highly
                disconnected, and it prevents knowledge generated in research
                from being put to effective use. Another study published in the
                Journal of Rural Studies found that the majority of small-scale
                farmers in Sri Lanka rely on informal networks and personal
                contacts for information, rather than formal channels of
                communication such as research institutes. These findings
                highlight the need for improved communication channels between
                farmers and research institutes to ensure that small-scale
                farmers have access to the latest research findings.

              <p class="ind">The technical complexity of research findings</p>
              <p>
                Small-scale farmers often struggle to understand the highly
                technical content of research papers. This can be due to several
                factors, including the farmers' level of education, the
                complexity of the research, and the use of specialized
                terminology. As a result, many small-scale farmers are unable to
                effectively apply the research findings to their operations.
                This highlights the need for research institutes to consider the
                audience for their research and to present the findings in a
                manner that is accessible to small-scale farmers. To further
                ensure myself met a few agricultural officers in different areas
                and discussed those issues with them. According to them those
                are also existing issues in the field. Small-scale farmers in
                Sri Lanka are currently receiving new research findings through
                agricultural officers. Before the Crisis in Sri Lanka, relevant
                officers had a close relationship with farmers. Officers went to
                farmers by their own vehicles to raise awareness of the new
                findings but with the fuel prices nowadays they cannot do that
                anymore.

          <p class="lastdes">
            Based on the discussions with agricultural officers and the findings
            derived from prior research endeavors, it is evident that the
            establishment of a structured and effective mechanism for the
            dissemination of research findings to small-scale farmers is seen as
            a critical imperative within the realm of agricultural development

                The system diagram depicted in the figure gives significant
                attention to the research findings dissemination component and
                its intricate connections with various system elements. The
                research findings dissemination system offers a mobile
                application for farmers to access research findings easily. A
                web application aids authorized officers in uploading and
                managing publications. The Flask server plays a central role in
                the system, with components like the controller managing
                requests and the service processing data. The PDF Processing and
                NLP Summarization Component extracts insights from research
                papers, while the Summarization Component distills the
                information into concise and readable summaries. The Node server
                ensures data persistence and retrieval, while the Flask server
                simplifies summarization. User input guides the process, leading
                to accessible research summaries.

              <p class="component">1. Data Collection and Analysis</p>

              <p class="description">
                For the data collection and analysis phase, began by conducting
                an extensive search of existing research categories and their
                associated research papers. The primary research categories
                relevant to paddy cultivation at the Rice Research and
                Development Institute (RRDI) were systematically identified.
                These categories encompassed a wide range of topics, including
                agronomy, plant breeding, weed science, soil science, grain
                quality, and water management.

                2. Extracting Abstract and Conclusion from PDF Research Paper
              </p>

              <p class="description">
                In the process of extracting abstract and conclusion sections
                from PDF research papers stored in Firebase, a systematic
                approach is employed. First, the PDF research papers stored in
                Firebase are accessed via their respective URLs. Robust
                techniques are implemented to identify the abstract and
                conclusion sections within the extracted text. This involves
                keyword-based recognition and pattern matching to pinpoint the
                beginnings and endings of these sections. Once the abstract and
                conclusion sections are identified, the relevant text is
                extracted.

                3. Identifying Relevant Pre-trained NLP Models for Summarization
                Task
              </p>

              <p class="description">
                In the process of developing the Natural Language Processing
                (NLP) model for summarization, a thorough search and evaluation
                of pre-trained NLP models were conducted. The objective was to
                select models that were particularly suited for the task of
                summarizing complex research papers into accessible formats for
                small-scale paddy farmers.

              <p class="component">4. Summarization Output</p>

              <p class="description">
                The abstract and conclusion sections from PDF research papers
                are sent to the summarization model as a single paragraph,
                allowing the model to generate concise summaries that capture
                essential insights and findings from each section. The
                summarization model processes the input and produces summarized
                content. These summaries aim to capture the key insights and
                findings from each research paper
              </p>

              <p class="component">5. Evaluate the Summarization Model</p>

              <p class="description">
                Use ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation)
                metrics to evaluate the models and conduct a human evaluation by
                having a group of human evaluators rate the summaries for
                readability, coherence, and informativeness. Ensure that the
                evaluators are blind to which model generated each summary. Rank
                the models based on their ROUGE scores and human evaluation
                scores
              </p>

              <p class="component">6. Utilizing Google Translate Public API</p>

              <p class="description">
                To facilitate the translation process, the Google Translate
                public API is employed. This accessible API serves as a valuable
                tool for translating the summarized content into multiple
                languages, enhancing accessibility and comprehension for a
                diverse audience
              </p>

              <p class="description">
                This methodology embodies a comprehensive strategy that merges
                data collection, Natural Language Processing (NLP) model
                development, multi-language support, and user-friendly
                interfaces. Its overarching purpose is to facilitate the
                seamless sharing of agricultural research insights with
                small-scale paddy farmers in Sri Lanka. By employing this
                approach, farmers are empowered to access and utilize the latest
                knowledge, ultimately enhancing their farming practices and
                boosting agricultural productivity in the region.
