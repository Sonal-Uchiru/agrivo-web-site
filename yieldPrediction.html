                Traditional methods of weather prediction have played a vital role in Sri Lanka's paddy cultivation for over two millennia. Ancient texts and oral traditions have preserved the wisdom of anticipating weather and its impact on agriculture. These methods incorporate observations of celestial body movements, seasonal transitions, animal behavior, and insect activity.

In modern times, traditional prediction methods have merged with scientific techniques, including meteorological data and satellite imagery. However, traditional methods continue to be essential, especially in rural areas where access to modern information is limited.

While traditional prediction methods have advantages, they also have limitations, including limited accuracy due to subjective observations, inflexibility in adapting to changing conditions, reliance on folklore and superstitions, labor-intensive practices, limited accessibility, and challenges in addressing the impacts of climate change. Balancing traditional wisdom with modern scientific knowledge is essential for ensuring the sustainability and resilience of Sri Lanka's agriculture.

                Research A
               
              </h3>
              <p>
                In 2021, researchers Piyal Ekanayake, Windhya Rankothge, Rukmal Weliwatta, and Jeevani W. Jayasinghe conducted a study on crop-weather models for paddy yield in Sri Lanka, focusing on various weather indices such as temperature, rainfall, and sunshine hours. The key areas addressed in their research include:

              <h3>Research B</h3>
              <p>
                In 2020 researchers named Vinushi Amarathunge, Lasini Wickramasinghe, Anushka Perera, Jeewani Jayasinghe and Upeka Rathnayake conducted research to obtain the relationships between paddy yield and climatic parameters for several paddy-grown areas in Sri Lanka namely Ampara, Batticaloa, Badulla, Bandarawela, Hambantota, Trincomalee, Kurunegala, and Puttalam. This paper points out the following key features.
              </p>
              <p>
                1. Regional Variations: One of the significant aspects of this research is its focus on multiple paddy-growing regions in Sri Lanka, including Ampara, Batticaloa, Badulla, Bandarawela, Hambantota, Trincomalee, Kurunegala, and Puttalam. Examining different regions allows for a comprehensive understanding of how local climatic variations impact paddy yield. This information is crucial for tailoring agricultural strategies to specific geographic conditions.
              </p>
              <p>
                2. Climate Change Adaptation: Understanding the relationships between climatic parameters and paddy yield is particularly relevant in the context of climate change. Sri Lanka, like many other countries, faces shifting weather patterns and increased climate variability. The research findings can inform adaptive strategies to help farmers cope with these changes, ensuring food security.
              </p>
              <p>
                3. Resource Optimization: The research findings may facilitate the optimization of resources such as water and fertilizers. Farmers can use climate data to determine when and how much irrigation is needed and adjust fertilizer application based on expected weather conditions, reducing waste and environmental impact.
              </p>
              <p>
                Artificial Neural Networks(ANN) was used to obtain the relationship between climatic variables and yield and predict yield estimation. Three training algorithms were used to train the developed ANN model. Among the three algorithms, results show that Levenberg–Marquardt (LM) has outperformed the other two in determining the relationship between climatic factors and paddy yield with less computational time. In summary, the research holds significant importance for Sri Lanka's agricultural sector. It provides valuable insights into how climatic parameters impact paddy yield in different regions, empowering farmers, policymakers, and researchers to make informed decisions aimed at increasing food security and adapting to a changing climate.

          </div>

          <p class="lastdes">
            While these research studies focus on climate variables, they often overlook the effect of non-climatic factors like soil qualities. Furthermore, while various forecasting apps are available, most do not provide solutions that account for both climatic and non-climatic factors influencing yield. The few that do exist tend to be costly or impractical for the majority of Sri Lanka's small-scale farmers. Because of that many rural farmers continue to rely on less effective traditional methods.

                Extensive research findings have shed light on the prevailing agricultural practices in Sri Lanka, revealing that a substantial portion, approximately 43% of the current population, continues to rely on traditional forecasting techniques for their farming endeavors. Alarmingly, an additional 40% of the population remains unaware of the potential alignment between traditional knowledge and modern weather reports. This dual challenge of traditionalism and limited awareness has significant ramifications, including resource allocation inefficiencies and financial hardships among the farming community.

In response to these pressing issues, our research endeavors culminated in the development of an innovative and technologically-driven solution: a mobile application designed to bridge the gap between traditional farming practices and modern precision agriculture. This application serves as a beacon of hope for small-scale paddy farmers, who are undeniably the lifeblood of Sri Lanka's economy. It offers them not only an opportunity to embrace technological solutions beyond their time-honored traditions but also provides access to an accurate yield prediction system that considers both climatic and non-climatic factors. The main beneficiaries of this innovative application are the hardworking small-scale paddy farmers in Sri Lanka, and its deployment has the potential to usher in a new era of agricultural sustainability and economic prosperity for this vital demographic.

To improve the model's performance preprocessing and feature engineering techniques were used. Through careful data cleaning, transformation, and selection, we were able to extract and emphasize the most pertinent features, thereby reducing noise and increasing the model's predictive power. Moreover, the incorporation of a novel "soil points" system, which evaluates the compatibility of soil qualities with preferred paddy types, played a crucial role in feature engineering, allowing for more precise yield estimations. In addition, increasing the size of the datasets also improved the model accuracy.

 In summary, these research findings will pave the way for a brighter future for Sri Lanka's small-scale paddy farmers, offering them technological solutions and accurate yield predictions while addressing traditionalism and awareness challenges in the agricultural sector.
